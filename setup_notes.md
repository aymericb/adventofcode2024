## How I installed Deno

See [documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)

I already have homebrew

```
brew install deno
```

Then I had to install [the Dino VSCode extension](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/vscode/)

And run the `Deno: Initialize Workspace Configuration` command.
