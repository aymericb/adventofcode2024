## Deno / TypeScript

```
deno task solve
```

## Issue

The main issue in part 2 which is not apparent in the sample, is that **more than one rule** may be broken by a given input.

I initially thought there would similar to the sample, where only one rule is breachedâ€¦ Took me some time to figure out that it was not the case.

My way to fix it is to basically swap every two numbers that are in breach a rule until there are no breaches left.

I suspect that's very inefficient. Complexity must be O^2, or very likely even worse.

It feels like a sort problem. And my implementation feels like a bubble sort implementation. This is what is in `solve.ts`

So, ideally, one would like to deploy the quick sort algorithm from JavaScript and use `.sort()` but the problem is that it's unclear how to order two values `a` and `b`.
