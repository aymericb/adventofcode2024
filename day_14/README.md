## Deno / TypeScript

```sh
deno task solve
```


Code is a mess. Did not like part 2, as I had no idea what I was looking for and my idea was that the entire picture or most of it who turn into an xMas tree, or that maybe the weird safety score thing would be at play, but it's not.

In the end someone on reddit said the tree was the place with the lower amount of overlapping robots. Tried that and lo and behold found the tree in the stuff I printed out. Anyway, it's a bit of a cheat. I did **not** figure this one out myself.
