## Deno / TypeScript

```
deno task solve
deno task solve2
```

My implementation for part 1 is quite rubbish. I did not understand the problem very well at first (thought you could change directions in the word search, which of course you can't!)

Part 2 uses a more straightforward approach which frankly would have worked well for part 1. 

## AI Generated for Deno / TypeScript

```
deno task solve_ai
```

This was entirely generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Cursor

I gave the AI this TypeScript

```
const text = await Deno.readTextFile("input.txt");
const grid = text.trim().split("\n").map(line => line.split(""));
```

And then used this prompt

```
Finish the attached Deno Typescript script to solve the following  puzzle. Print out the number of finds from input.txt *and* the debugging chart into the console. 

Here's the problem statement of the script. The data is already loaded from input.txt

[... copy text from advent of code...]
```

Took about a second and the generated code works. It's definitely better than mine, especially in terms of performanceâ€¦ ðŸ¤¯
